# NPCs
A repository for general NPC creation and sharing. Mainly JSON files from http://monster.pf2.tools
You should title your NPCs as "Lv [insert level] [two-word summary]", such as "Lv10 primal archer" or "lv2 gang assassin".
If uploading a monster, simply use "Lv [insert level] [monster name] ([monster family])", such as "lv9 Zelekhut (Inevitable)".
