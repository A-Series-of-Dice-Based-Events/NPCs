# NPCs
A repository for general NPC creation and sharing. Mainly JSON files from http://monster.pf2.tools

You should title your NPCs as "Lv [insert level] [two-word summary] ([creature role])", such as "Lv10 primal archer (sniper)" or "lv2 gang assassin (skirmisher)".

If uploading a monster, simply use "Lv [insert level] [monster name] ([monster family])", such as "lv9 Zelekhut (Inevitable)".
