A creature grabbed by the scroll cannot see, speak (blind condition), or cast spells with verbal components, and it must hold its breath (see Suffocation page 478 CRB). Creatures that don’t speak or breathe through their heads aren’t affected in this manner, nor are those blinded who can see through other means. Any attacks targeting a guardian scroll while it’s constricting its target deal half damage to the scroll and the other half to the grabbed creature."},{"id":"_2tqhbh47g54","name":"Constrict","traits":"","range":"","actions":"one","type":"offense","description":"1d6+2 bludgeoning to a creature who has been grabbed plus smothering wrap."}],"alignment":"n","size":"tiny","type":"construct","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"10 feet, fly 40 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","strength":{"value":"3","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"4","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"-3","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"1","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"1","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":"7","benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision, low-light vision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"10","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"8","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"17","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"35","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"14","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":"6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"all physical 5 (except magic) ","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"Fire 6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":" bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious, bludgeoning, and falling damage","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","strikes":[{"id":"_15ft478odq8","name":"Slicke","traits":"agile, finesse, magical","attack":"11","damage":"1d6+2 slashing plus grab, plus persistent damage 1","type":"Melee"}],"hints":["perception","strength","dexterity","constitution","intelligence","wisdom","charisma","ac","fortitude","reflex","will","hp"],"languages":"common"}
