This “bone chariot” functions as if the corpse had reanimated and gained the skeleton template, but gains the construct type instead of the undead type and has no will of its own—it moves and attacks at the direction of the ostovite, which rides in its center.\n\nAn ostovite cannot use its own attacks while ensconced in its bone chariot, and damage done to a bone chariot does not harm the ostovite until the bone chariot has been reduced to 0 hit points, at which point the skeleton crumbles and the ostovite can attack and be attacked as normal.\n\nMultiple ostovites can combine their abilities to animate the skeletons of larger creatures, so long as they all ride within the same bone chariot—each additional ostovite increases the maximum rating of the corpse that can be animated by this ability by 2.\n"}],"alignment":"n","size":"tiny","type":"animal","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"25","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","strength":{"value":"0","benchmark":"low","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"4","benchmark":"high","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"+2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"-4","benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"+2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"-4","benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"perception":{"value":"+7","benchmark":"moderate","note":"Darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"3","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"10","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"15","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"19","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"7","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"10","benchmark":"high","note":""},"will":{"value":"4","benchmark":"low","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","strikes":[{"id":"_crwcvap9n2g","name":"Mandibles","traits":"Finesse","attack":"7","damage":"1d4+2 and 1d6 acid","type":"Melee"}],"hints":["perception","strength","dexterity","constitution","intelligence","wisdom","charisma","ac","fortitude","reflex","will","hp"],"languages":"Abyssal"}
