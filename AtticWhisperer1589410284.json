All of the voices that an attic whisperer steals linger around it in an invisible but audible aura of unnerving childlike whimpers, songs, and sobs.

During that time, the creature cannot talk, cast spells with verbal components, or use effects with the verbal trait. Once an attic whisperer has stolen a creature’s voice, it can perfectly mimic that voice at any time, even after its victim’s voice has returned, and while using that voice can speak any languages the victim knew. Those familiar with an individual’s voice can make a Perception check against the attic whisperer’s Deception DC to realise a mimicked voice is inauthentic."},{"id":"_cfgpww36b5c","name":"Goodnight Kiss","traits":"curse, enchantment, occult","range":"","actions":"three","type":"offense","description":"A sleeping creature kissed by the attic whisperer falls into a permanent sleep and is subject to Steal Voice.
