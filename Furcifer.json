Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn’t immobilized, but it can’t move beyond the reach of the furcifer’s tongue. A creature can sever the tongue by hitting AC 25 and dealing at least 45 slashing damage. Though this doesn’t deal any damage to the furcifer, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week."},{"id":"_15c49m1zgkh","name":"Pull","traits":"","range":"","actions":"one","type":"offense","description":"Requirements The furcifer has currently grabbed a creature using it's tongue grab ability.
